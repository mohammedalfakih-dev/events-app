# Loc Events

A Netherlands event-discovery app backed by a Ticketmaster data pipeline: API ingestion, raw storage, dbt transformations, Airflow orchestration and PostgreSQL publishing.

This is my personal portfolio fork of the [HYF Class 55, Group A project](https://github.com/HackYourFutureProjects/c55-final-project-group-A). My role was **data engineering**, working alongside another data engineer, frontend and backend teammates, and HYF mentors.

## My contribution

- **Ticketmaster ingestion:** implemented API integration, validation and pagination. [PR #8](https://github.com/HackYourFutureProjects/c55-final-project-group-A/pull/8)
- **Source coverage:** expanded fetching across five 30-day date windows and deduplicated events by Ticketmaster ID. [PR #97](https://github.com/HackYourFutureProjects/c55-final-project-group-A/pull/97)
- **Reliable publishing:** changed the PostgreSQL refresh to staging, transactional truncate and insert, preserving the existing table and its dependent views, permissions and indexes. [PR #89](https://github.com/HackYourFutureProjects/c55-final-project-group-A/pull/89)
- **Orchestration integration:** connected the backend publishing step to the data workflow. [PR #76](https://github.com/HackYourFutureProjects/c55-final-project-group-A/pull/76)
- **Pipeline monitoring:** customized the supplied Streamlit starter into a read-only health dashboard covering event counts, price coverage, freshness and landing files. [PR #117](https://github.com/HackYourFutureProjects/c55-final-project-group-A/pull/117)

The application and data platform are team work built on HYF-provided foundations. The frontend, backend, infrastructure baseline and other data transformations have their own contributors. See [my contribution notes](docs/my-contributions.md) for the decisions and evidence behind my work.

This is our final project for the [HackYourFuture program](https://hackyourfuture.net/program), built as a
team with three roles: frontend, backend, and data engineering. We worked in an agile way, in short
sprints, supported by a group of mentors: a Product Manager and Tech Leads. The project is open source and available
on GitHub.

This is the team's hosted application, not a separate deployment of this portfolio fork.

## About the project

**Loc Events** is a web app for finding something to do in the Netherlands. Ticketmaster events and events created by
admins land in one feed, so you do not have to check several sites.

Anyone can browse what is on. Signed-in users can save events, mark Going, and get reminded. Admins add and manage
events in the same product.

## High-level Architecture

Three tracks, three layers, and one database where two of them meet.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    EXT["External sources"]

    subgraph de["Data"]
        ING["Ingest raw records"]
        MODEL["Clean, deduplicate, join"]
        MART[("Published tables")]
    end

    subgraph be["Backend"]
        API["REST API"]
        subgraph db["One PostgreSQL database"]
            ANA[("analytics schema: data writes")]
            APP[("app schema: backend writes")]
            ANA ~~~ APP
        end
    end

    subgraph fe["Frontend"]
        UI["Web application"]
    end

    EXT --> ING --> MODEL --> MART
    MART -->|"outbound sync, daily"| ANA
    ANA -->|"read only"| API
    API -->|"read and write"| APP
    UI -->|"HTTP, JSON"| API
    User([User]) --> UI
    APP -.->|"inbound sync, optional"| MODEL

    classDef d fill:#e8f4ea,stroke:#4a8055
    classDef b fill:#e8eef7,stroke:#4a6080
    classDef f fill:#f7f0e8,stroke:#806a4a
    class ING,MODEL,MART d
    class ANA,APP,API b
    class UI f
```

The application database holds two schemas. **`analytics`** is written by the
data pipeline and read by the backend. **`app`** holds accounts, saved items and
anything the application's own admins create, and only the backend writes it.

The architecture follows three principles:

- **The two schemas have two owners.** The data pipeline writes `analytics` and
  nothing else. The backend writes `app` and nothing else. Neither side has
  permission to write the other's, which is enforced by two database roles
  rather than by everyone remembering.
- **The data track publishes finished tables, not raw material.** The backend
  should be able to fill a screen with one `SELECT`, without joining sources or
  knowing where a row came from.
- **Records the application creates stay on the application's side.** If an
  admin adds a record by hand and the same thing later arrives from an external
  source, deciding they are the same thing is application logic. It happens
  behind the API, not in the pipeline.

## CI/CD

The repository includes three component CI/CD workflows:

| Workflow                                                | Triggers on                 | What it does                                                        |
|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Backend CI/CD](.github/workflows/backend-ci-cd.yaml)   | changes under `backend/**`  | Checkstyle, tests, Docker build; pushes the image to GHCR on `main` |
| [Frontend CI/CD](.github/workflows/frontend-ci-cd.yaml) | changes under `frontend/**` | Lint, build, Docker build; pushes the image to GHCR on `main`       |
| [Data CI/CD](.github/workflows/data-ci-cd.yaml) | changes under `data/**` or its workflow | Python/SQL checks, tests, DAG imports; builds and publishes the ingestion image to ACR in the team deployment setup |

These workflows describe the team's deployment setup. Azure deployment from a personal fork requires its own authorized configuration; the fork does not automatically inherit the team's deployment access.

## Roadmap

- [ ] More event sources besides Ticketmaster
- [ ] Recommendations based on what you saved or marked Going, not only similar events
- [ ] A clearer admin role, with tighter app logic and design
